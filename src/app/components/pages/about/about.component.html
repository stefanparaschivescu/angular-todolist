    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>This is TodoApp v 1.0.0</p>
    <p>Try to add something you have to do to the <b>list</b> by clicking the submit button. </p>
    <p>Form submit doesn't generate todo.id. This app uses a test API and so in the real world, the database would auto-increment the value of the id.</p>
