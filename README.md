# Angular Todolist
#
**IMPORTANT!**
*Form submit doesn't generate todo.id.*
***This web app uses a test API (not a real one)*** and so in the real world, the database would auto-increment the value of the id.
**Because it doesn't have a backend service to update the database, when the user deletes one of the todos it deletes every todos inserted.**
In future will have a small backend implementation and database with users to resolve this bug.
